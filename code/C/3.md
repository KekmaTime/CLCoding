## Sample Algorithm

1. **Start Program:**
   - The program begins its execution.

2. **Input Maximum Degrees:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the maximum degrees for two polynomials.
   - Read the maximum degree for the first polynomial into `max_degree1`.
   - Read the maximum degree for the second polynomial into `max_degree2`.

3. **Create Arrays:**
   - Create arrays `poly1` and `poly2` to store coefficients for the first and second polynomials respectively, with sizes determined by the maximum degrees.

4. **Input Coefficients for First Polynomial:**
   - Prompt the user to enter coefficients for the first polynomial.
   - Read the coefficients into the `poly1` array.

5. **Input Coefficients for Second Polynomial:**
   - Prompt the user to enter coefficients for the second polynomial.
   - Read the coefficients into the `poly2` array.

6. **Initialize Sum Polynomial Array:**
   - Create an array `sum_poly` to store the sum of the polynomials, with a size based on the higher of the two maximum degrees.

7. **Calculate Sum of Polynomials:**
   - Iterate through the degrees from the highest to the lowest.
   - Calculate the sum of coefficients at each degree and store in `sum_poly` array.
   - Display the coefficients and degrees for the sum of the polynomials.

8. **End Program:**
   - The program ends its execution.
